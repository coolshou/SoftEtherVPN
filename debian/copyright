Comment:
 The Debianisation had no explicit license until January 2020 when MIT
 was added to the repo; however, most of it has been rewritten from
 scratch except the init scripts and the control file. It is likely
 the remaining parts are not copyrightable anyway, so for simplicity
 all of the Debian metadata is better kept under the same license as
 the upstream code.
